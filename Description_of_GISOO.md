## What is GISOO? ##

GISOO is a virtual testbed for simulation of wireless cyber-physical systems that integrates two state-of-the art simulators, [Simulink](http://www.mathworks.se/products/simulink/) and [COOJA](http://www.contiki-os.org/start.html). GISOO enables users to evaluate actual embedded code for the wireless nodes in realistic cyber-physical experiments, observing the effects of both the control and communication components. In this way, a wide range of communication solutions can be evaluated without developing abstract models of their control-relevant aspects, and changes made to the networking code in simulations is guaranteed to be translated into production code without errors.

## What can I find here? ##

In the content list on the navigation column on the left you can find the installation guide and how to use GISOO. Examples are provided, which can help you start developing your own applications.

GISOO's examples are currently developed for TinyOS and telosb, tmote sky or CM5000 nodes, which all have an [MSP430 uC](http://www.ti.com/lsds/ti/microcontroller/16-bit_msp430/overview.page?DCMP=MCU_other&HQS=msp430) and a [CC2420 radio](http://www.ti.com/product/cc2420). However, through COOJA, GISOO can support many other platforms. GISOO also supports the most popular wireless sensor networks operating systems: [TinyOS](http://www.tinyos.net/) and [Contiki OS](http://www.contiki-os.org/start.html). However, we are still working on developing our examples to Contiki OS.
