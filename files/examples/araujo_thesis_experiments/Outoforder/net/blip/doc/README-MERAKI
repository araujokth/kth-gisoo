This README explains how to use a Meraki Mini programmed with
OpenWRT/kamikaze as a border router.  This document and the code make
the following assumptions:

 - The Meraki has a public IP address or is in a DMZ such that the
        6over4 tunneling protocol will work.
 - The Meraki is the sole router for a prefix

Background
---------------------------------------------------------------------

To ease configuration, the important parameters are stored in a
database.  When the meraki waits up, it hits the database and
downloads a few config files which it then uses.  To grab new
configuration, you can either log in and manually restart the router
daemon, or just reboot.  The parameters stored are:
 prefix : the one received from the hurricane electric tunnel broker
 short addr : the address of this device on the network
 channel : which channel to use

Install
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 1. Install the router daemon on the meraki using either the provided
ipkg, or your own if you've built a version.  Building the package is
very easy but not covered here.
   'ipkg update'
   'ipkg install lowpan-bridge_1.2-855_mips.ipk' 
In order for the dependancies to be automatically installed, you must
do the update first so that the package system downloads the directory
with the necessary packages.
 2. Set up the configuration parameters in the database.  The key used
is the hostname; precisely, whatever 'uname -n' prints.  If no key is
found in the database the meraki will just use defaults.
 3. Start the daemon with '/etc/init.d/lowpan-bridge start' This will
run automatically when the meraki boots.

... I think that's it.  Pretty easy!

Bugs/Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------

There seems to be an issue with the serial port on the meraki.  The
effect is that packets are dropped when you send too quickly.  This
mostly effects fragmentation.  As a stopgap, I've inserted a timeout
between fragments, but this means the performance is somewhat worse
then on a PC and a micaz.
